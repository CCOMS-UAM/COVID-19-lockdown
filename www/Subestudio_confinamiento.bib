	abstract = {The standard estimate of prevalence is the proportion of positive results obtained from the application of a diagnostic test to a random sample of individuals drawn from the population of interest. When the diagnostic test is imperfect, this estimate is biased. We give simple formulae, previously described by Greenland (1996) for correcting the bias and for calculating confidence intervals for the prevalence when the sensitivity and specificity of the test are known. We suggest a Bayesian method for constructing credible intervals for the prevalence when sensitivity and specificity are unknown. We provide
              R
              code to implement the method.},

	abstract = {The impact of survey design on standard multinomial-based methods for a multiway contingency table is studied, under nested loglinear models. The asymptotic null distribution of the Pearson chi-squared test statistic, X2 (or the likelihood ratio test statistic, G2) is obtained as a weighted sum of independent χ2 1 random variables, and the weights are then related to the familiar design effects (deffs) used by survey samplers. A simple correction to X2 (or G2) is also obtained which requires the knowledge of only the cell deffs and the deffs for collapsed tables (marginals), whenever the model admits a direct solution of likelihood equations under multinomial sampling. Finally, an example on the relative performance of X2 and some corrected X2 statistics in a three-way table is given, using some data from the Canada Health Survey, 1978-1979.},

	abstract = {The aim of developing the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) was to have a tool that would produce valid and reliable estimates of physical activity, especially relevant to developing countries where patterns of energy expenditure differ from developed countries because people experience diverse ways of life. The development of a standardized tool to measure physical activity that enables comparisons across culturally diverse populations is a challenging task. Comparable, valid, and reliable information on physical activity enables countries to follow trends over time, understand regional and global comparisons, and better inform physical activity policy decisions. A WHO expert working group on physical activity measurement provided a draft GPAQ for global consultation. The draft instrument was validated in nine countries. Validation studies and qualitative feedback on GPAQ were presented at an Expert Meeting on Global Physical Activity Surveillance held jointly by WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second round of global consultation led to minor revisions and preparation of a final GPAQ version 2 instrument (GPAQv2). Around 50 developing countries are now using GPAQ for physical activity data collection. GPAQv2 is a suitable physical activity surveillance instrument for developing countries.},

	abstract = {Resilience is defined as the ability to recover from stress. However, all resilience measures with exception of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) assess resources that make resilience possible instead of recovery. The purpose of this study was to translate the BRS to Spanish and to analyze the reliability and validity of its scores. The psychometric properties of its scores were examined in a heterogeneous sample of 620 Spanish adults. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out to study its scores’ evidence of structural validity. Besides, to study its scores’ evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in relation to other resilience questionnaires (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 10-item version, Situated Subjective Resilience Questionnaire for Adults and Resiliency Questionnaire for Adults) and to variables such as emotions (Modified Differential Emotions Scale), coping (Person-situation Coping Questionnaire for Adults), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), correlation and regression analyses were conducted. To study its sensitivity, we assessed the effect of sociodemographics and the ability of the scale to identify high-risk populations by conducting analyses of variance and Pearson correlations. The BRS scores showed adequate reliability (α = .83; intraclass coefficient = .69). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the Spanish version of the BRS is mono-factorial (χ2/df = 2.36; standardized root mean square residual = .036; goodness-of-fit index = .980; comparative fit index = .984; incremental fit index = .984; root mean square error of approximation = .067). They also showed adequate evidence of the scores’ convergent, concurrent and predictive validity. The Spanish version of the BRS is a reliable and valid means to assess resilience as the ability to bounce back. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The WMH-CIDI includes a screening module and 40 sections that focus on diagnoses (22 sections), functioning (four sections), treatment (two sections), risk factors (four sections), socio-demographic correlates (seven sections), and methodological factors (two sections). Innovations compared to earlier versions of the CIDI include expansion of the diagnostic sections, a focus on 12-month as well as lifetime disorders in the same interview, detailed assessment of clinical severity, and inclusion of information on treatment, risk factors, and consequences. A computer-assisted version of the interview is available along with a direct data entry software system that can be used to keypunch responses to the paper-and-pencil version of the interview. Computer programs that generate diagnoses are also available based on both ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. Elaborate CD-ROM-based training materials are available to teach interviewers how to administer the interview as well as to teach supervisors how to monitor the quality of data collection.

	abstract = {Objective To explore the associations between health and how people evaluate and experience their lives.
Methods We analysed data from nationally-representative household surveys originally conducted in 2011–2012 in Finland, Poland and Spain. These surveys provided information on 10 800 adults, for whom experienced well-being was measured using the Day Reconstruction Method and evaluative well-being was measured with the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale. Health status was assessed by questions in eight domains including mobility and self-care. We used multiple linear regression, structural equation models and multiple indicators/ multiple causes models to explore factors associated with experienced and evaluative well-being. Findings The multiple indicator/multiple causes model conducted over the pooled sample showed that respondents with younger age (eﬀect size, β = 0.19), with higher levels of education (β = −0.12), a history of depression (β = −0.17), poor health status (β = 0.29) or poor cognitive functioning (β = 0.09) reported worse experienced well-being. Additional factors associated with worse evaluative well-being were male sex (β = −0.03), not living with a partner (β = 0.07), and lower occupational (β = −0.07) or income levels (β = 0.08). Health status was the factor most strongly correlated with both experienced and evaluative well-being, even after controlling for a history of depression, age, income and other sociodemographic variables.
Conclusion Health status is an important correlate of well-being. Therefore, strategies to improve population health would also improve people’s well-being.},
